# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

A responsive and interactive web application for predicting diabetes based on medical input features using a trained Machine Learning model (SVM). Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and deployed for free.

---

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 **ML Model (SVM)**: Trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
- 🌐 **Frontend**: Beautiful, animated UI with form validations and prediction feedback.
- 🔥 **Flask Backend**: Handles predictions with your trained model and scaler.
- ⚡ **Deployed Free**: On Render.com using GitHub integration.
- 📊 **Prediction Output**: Binary result (Positive/Negative) with user-friendly display.
